# Ed
Event-driven backtesting engine written in C++

Ed is a high performance (hopefully), event-driven backtesting engine for trading strategies written in C++. 

I plan on incrementally adding extra functionality such as exporting backtest reports in PDF format, running Monte Carlo simulations, adding extra visualizations etc.
